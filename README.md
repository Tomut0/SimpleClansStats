## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Docker

To run SimpleClansStats under Docker, you have to use `minat0/scstats:latest` docker image in your compose file. \
Example is located [here](https://github.com/Tomut0/SimpleClansStats/tree/master/docker).

### Web server

#### Prerequisites

* Any http server. Most popular are Nginx or Apache.
* PHP v8.1 or higher
* Composer v2.7.2 or higher
* Node.js v20.12.2 or higher
* npm v10.8.2 or higher

#### Step by step

1. Clone from master branch or download from [release](https://github.com/Tomut0/SimpleClansStats/releases) page.
2. Install php dependencies through composer:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

3. Install and build node.js dependencies through npm:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

4. Make copy of `.env.example` to `.env` and set up it.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

You have to change `DB_`, `SC_` settings to connect to the databases. \
Make sure `SC_` database has `sc_players`, `sc_clans`, `sc_kills` tables to work finely.

5. Add task scheduling rule to crontab.

```bash 
crontab -e 
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

6. Configure your http server to process the SCStats. \
   You may look an example of Nginx
   configuration [here](https://github.com/Tomut0/SimpleClansStats/blob/master/docker/nginx.conf). \
   Don't forget to change `fastcgi_pass scstats:9000;` to your php-fpm server.

7. Profit!
